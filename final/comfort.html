<div class="filmname1"><h2>ALLAN KAPROW</h2>
    <p>
 (August 23, 1927 – April 5, 2006) was an American painter, assemblagist and a pioneer in establishing the concepts of performance art. He helped to develop the "Environment" and "Happening" in the late 1950s and 1960s, as well as their theory. His Happenings — some 200 of them — evolved over the years. Eventually Kaprow shifted his practice into what he called "Activities", intimately scaled pieces for one or several players, devoted to the study of normal human activity in a way congruent to ordinary life. Fluxus, performance art, and installation art were, in turn, influenced by his work.

<div class="filmname2"><h2>TEHCHING HSIEH</h2>
<p>(December 31, 1950) Hsieh was one of 15 children from a family in southern Taiwan; his father, Ching Hsieh had five wives. He dropped out from high school and started creating paintings; he went on to create several performance pieces after finishing his three years of compulsory military service in Taiwan. In 1974, he jumped ship to a pier on the Delaware River, near Philadelphia,[3] and made his way to New York City, working as a dishwasher and cleaner during his first four years there.From 1978 to 1986, Hsieh accomplished five One Year Performances; from 1986–1999, he worked on what he called his "Thirteen-Year Plan". On 1 January 2000, in his report to the public, he announced that he had kept himself alive. He stopped making art since then.</p>
